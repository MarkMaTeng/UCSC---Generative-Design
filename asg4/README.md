In this assignment, I use one-point crossover to implement the reproduce.
The result seem like not change too much, and the car fitness is around 0 to 0.4. the crossover still need to be improved to reproduce more good car. 
My best car has 0.67 fitness. It just occurs 3 times and then the fitness go back to 0 to 0.4.
