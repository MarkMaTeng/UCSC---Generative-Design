In this assignment, I use Amplitude to adjust the particle's size and color and velocity. 
For particle's size, I map the audio level from 0 to 300. The size of the particle will change when the audio level change.
For the color of the particle, I use random number, life and the audio level to adjust the color of the particle.
For velocitym, I map the audio level from 0 to 100. When the audio level is larger than 50, I will accelerate the particle.
