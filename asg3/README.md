In this assignment, I use three rules.
rulesa = {"F": "FF-[-F+F]+[+F-F]"};
rulesb = {"F": "FF+[+F-F]-[-F+F]"};
rulesc = {"F": "F+F"};
This rule set will generate grass. Rulesa will lead the grass askew to right. The rulesb will lead the grass askew to left. 
The rulesc will lead the grass higher. The probability of rulesc is only 5% so it usually not be used.
