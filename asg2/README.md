In this assignment, I use noise to generate the z value of the terrain. 
My world generator map the noise from 0-1 to 0-depth. After generate the the noise, I can have all xyz value and thus I can create the terrain.
Also, I map the nois from 0-1 to 0-100. This value is the elevation that used to give the type(water, grass or dirt) of the cube.
